  I’m about to release a jedit plugin I wrote to provide eclipse like perspectives for jedit.
%p
  You can get it
  %a{ :href => "/assets/2006/10/13/Perspectives.jar" }
    here
%p
  Just drop it into your jedit jars directory.
%p
  I’d appreciate any feedback. Please add your comments here… Thanks
%p
  I’ll post more after the official release.
