  I’m off tomorrow to Prague in the Czech republic and will then make my way to
  %a{ :href => "http://ostrava.rails.cz/en/about" }
    Ostrava
  where I’ll be giving a talk about Globalize and it’s future.
%p
  I’ll be posting the slides here on my blog once I’m back.

  Say hello if you’re there :)
