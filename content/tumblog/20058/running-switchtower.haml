  I’m now running
  %a{ :href => "http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17" }
    switchtower.
%p
  Easy peasy to setup. I basically followed instructions in the manual.
%ol
  %li
    svn co http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/trunk/switchtower/
  %li
    rake gem
  %li
    Created a basic recipe (deploy.rb) from the example and stuck it in $RAILS_APP_ROOT/config/deploy.rb
  %li
    type:
    %code
      switchtower -r config/deploy.rb -a deploy
  %li
    Watch how your app get’s deployed  with no other action on your part.
  %p
    Well worth the five minutes effort to get the recipe file written up.
  %p
    Couldn’t find the s’pinner/spawner/reaper’ scripts but I haven’t looked in the rails svn trunk yet.
  %p
    Example:
  %p
    I fixed the ‘Weaning Problem’ I was having with bligi on my laptop this morning.
  %p
    When I had it working, all I had to do was type the above command, and a minute later I could post live with bligi.
  %p
    That’s the way I like things to go…Smoothly. ;)

    %span.caps
      TODO
    \: As I’ve only got the basic package at textdrive (i.e. 300Megs), I’m going to have to limit the number of app versions to three (Current version and the last two). An ‘after_deploy’ task should do the trick. ;)
