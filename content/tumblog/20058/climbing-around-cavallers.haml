  Weekend in the pyrenees. Nice opportunity to go climbing.
%p
  I borrowed a copy of
  %a{ :href => "http://www.onaclimb.com/guies/index.htm" }
    ‘Roca Caliente (Hot Rock) en los Pirineos’
  by
  %a{ :href => "http://www.onaclimb.com/luichy/index.htm" }
    Luis Alfonso
  \. Decided that the best place would be around the
  %a{ :href => "http://www.tinet.org/%7Eearguis/Catalunya/FotosCatalunya/Aiguestortes/bigimages/31%20Embalse%20Cavallers.jpg" }
    ‘Cavallers’ dam
  (15 minutes drive from Caldes de Boi in the ‘Parc Nacional de Aigues Tortes i St.Maurici’).
%p
  I basically chose something quite easy as Maria hasn’t climbed a lot. We went to the
  %strong
    ‘Kanalla’
  sector which is basically mostly IV and a couple of V/V+.
%p
  I setup a IV route for her, which she climbed quite well, but which shook her a bit. It’s very easy but it’s basically all adhesion.
%p
  She didn’t want to climb after that, but was quite happy to belay me. I only did a few routes myself (A couple at IV and 1 at IV+), but they were a joy to climb.
%p
  And the setting was just fantastic. (I have photos which I’ll be posting just as soon as I can get the photo app part of bligi up).
%p
  I’m definitely going to go back and try something a bit more testing…
