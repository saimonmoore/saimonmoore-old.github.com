<p>Rails 1.0 was released the other day and I promptly upgraded which involved all of:</p>   <pre><code> gem update rails -y  rake update_javascripts </code></pre>      <p>As this last command only updated the core scriptaculous scripts and I was using others too, I decided to improve on the rake task.</p>       <p>I came up with a quick hack that did the job by checking out scriptaculous head and then copying over the required files.</p>       <p>Technoweenie pointed out that it would be far better not to checkout the code every time which was a good idea, so I quickly corrected the code.</p>       <p>I then tried to test the task, but I started getting a host not found exception for dev.rubyonrails.org. I pinged it and it was indeed failing. I asked around on #rubyonrails and others weren&#8217;t having any probs at all. I quickly checked other sites, and didn&#8217;t have any problems with them. &#8220;Strange&#8221;, I thought.</p>       <p>To cut a long story short, after a great deal of investigating with tracepath, ethereal and google I had a productive little chat on #gentoo-uk with NeddySeagoon who came up with the answer:  &#8220;A server on a hop between me and the target site most probably had it&#8217;s dns poisoned. It should be fixed within 48 hours max.&#8221;</p>       <p>Sure enough, 48 hours later I could access dev.rubyonrails.org and test out the rake task (which you can find <a href=http://rails.techno-weenie.net/tip/2005/12/14/rake_task_to_update_scriptaculous_javascripts_directly_from_svn_trunk>here</a>  ). I lost a lot of time with that networking interlude, but I didn&#8217;t come away empty-handed.</p>       <p>On the way to enlightenment by NeddySeagoon I learned about <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTU_%28networking%29><acronym title=Maximum Transmission Unit><span class=caps><span class="caps">MTU</span></span></acronym></a> and how over cautious sysadmins can sometime cause problems with packets travelling over the pppoE channel.</p>       <p>So I learnt a bit more about networking..which is good ;)</p><p></p>
