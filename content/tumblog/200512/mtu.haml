  Rails 1.0 was released the other day and I promptly upgraded which involved all of:
%pre
  %code
    gem update rails -y  rake update_javascripts
%p
  As this last command only updated the core scriptaculous scripts and I was using others too, I decided to improve on the rake task.
%p
  I came up with a quick hack that did the job by checking out scriptaculous head and then copying over the required files.
%p
  Technoweenie pointed out that it would be far better not to checkout the code every time which was a good idea, so I quickly corrected the code.
%p
  I then tried to test the task, but I started getting a host not found exception for dev.rubyonrails.org. I pinged it and it was indeed failing. I asked around on #rubyonrails and others weren’t having any probs at all. I quickly checked other sites, and didn’t have any problems with them. “Strange”, I thought.
%p
  To cut a long story short, after a great deal of investigating with tracepath, ethereal and google I had a productive little chat on #gentoo-uk with NeddySeagoon who came up with the answer:  “A server on a hop between me and the target site most probably had it’s dns poisoned. It should be fixed within 48 hours max.”
%p
  Sure enough, 48 hours later I could access dev.rubyonrails.org and test out the rake task (which you can find
  %a{ :href => "http://rails.techno-weenie.net/tip/2005/12/14/rake_task_to_update_scriptaculous_javascripts_directly_from_svn_trunk" }
    here
  ). I lost a lot of time with that networking interlude, but I didn’t come away empty-handed.
%p
  On the way to enlightenment by NeddySeagoon I learned about
  %a{ :href => "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTU_%28networking%29" }
    %acronym{ :title => "Maximum", :unit => "", :transmission => "" }
      %span.caps
        %span.caps
          MTU
  and how over cautious sysadmins can sometime cause problems with packets travelling over the pppoE channel.
%p
  So I learnt a bit more about networking..which is good ;)
