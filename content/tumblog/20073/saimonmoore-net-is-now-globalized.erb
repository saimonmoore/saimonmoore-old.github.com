<p>Back up again&#8230;</p>


	<p>The process of rebuilding my <a href="https://manage.slicehost.com/customers/signup?referrer=10144130">slice</a> was relatively painless. It took me all of four hours to go from my original mephisto installation, to a completely new <a href="https://manage.slicehost.com/customers/signup?referrer=10144130">slice</a> with a <a href="http://www.webtypes.com/2007/03/18/globalizing-mephisto">globalized</a> mephisto trunk, restored subversion repository.</p>


	<p>Twice! As I also host a veterinary clinic <a href="http://ktiniatreio.gr">site</a> for a friend.</p>
