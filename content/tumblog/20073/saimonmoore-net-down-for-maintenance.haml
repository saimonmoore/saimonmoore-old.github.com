%p
  To all my  loyal readers (all 6 of you :).
%p
  I’m taking the site down temporarily as I want to rebuild it using
  %a{ :href => "http://www.webtypes.com/2007/03/15/announcing-capistrano-server-extensions" }
    Capistrano Server Extensions
  and the latest
  %a{ :href => "http://mephistoblog.com" }
    Mephisto
  trunk with my
  %a{ :href => "svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/sidirodromos/plugins/mephisto_i18n/trunk" }
    Mephisto I18n plugin
  (An article about this plugin will be coming
  %a{ :href => "#", :onclick => "alert('Coming soon...'); return false;" }
    forthwith
  ). To eat my own dog food as they say.
%p
  Also I’m not very happy about the site’s styling so I’m going to try and change that soon as well.
%p
  Back soon…
