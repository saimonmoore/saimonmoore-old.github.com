    folding bicycle
  last night. It was completely my fault. I had locked it to the metro entrance at around 20:00 and went to have dinner with Ana. By the time I got back, it had disappeared without a trace. Not even the chain was there.

  It wasn’t very wise of me locking it there but I’d been hauling it around all day and as we weren’t sure where we were going to end up for dinner, I decided to leave it by the metro.

  On the bright side, I’ve still got the seat. (Anyone looking to by a comfy bicycle seat? ;)

  Note to the crook: You bastard. ;)
