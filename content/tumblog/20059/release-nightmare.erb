<p>This weekend I did a 32 hour non-stop stint releasing the latest version of <a href=http://www.condisline.com/>CondisLine.com</a>.</p>       <p>This was a massive change as we were changing hardware (2 db servers, 2 web servers, 2 app servers, 2 firewall/proxies) &amp; software (complete revamp of the site under <span class=caps><span class="caps">ATG 7</span></span>.1), communications infrastructure &amp; security, data model migration (If you&#8217;ve ever seen the <span class=caps><span class="caps">ATG DCS</span></span> data model you know the kind of hell it was, I had to migrate from our proprietary 5.1.1 version to our proprietary 7.1 version).</p>       <p>At around 4-7 in the morning, I wasn&#8217;t particularly lucid but second wind then kicked in and we opened the tap at around 13:00 hrs on the Sunday.</p>       <p>We&#8217;re still cleaning up some stuff but considering, I&#8217;d say things went really well.</p><p></p>
