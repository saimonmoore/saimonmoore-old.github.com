  This Saturday, I managed to organize a trip to
  %a{ :href => "http://www.oliana.info/IMG_0091.JPG" }
    Oliana Dam
  to do the
  %a{ :href => "http://ferratas.barrancos.org/Oliana.htm" }
    Via ferrata Regina
  (See some very nice photos
  %a{ :href => "http://www.olivella.org/Muntanya/Primavera/regina_2003/" }
    here
  pending my own very nice photos.).
%p
  We were originally going to be doing the Via ferrata at
  %a{ :href => "http://ferratas.barrancos.org/Centelles.htm" }
    Centelles
  with Nuria (I go climbing with her) but she couldn’t make it this weekend, so hitched a ride with Toni, Merce, Santi and Mariona.
%p
  I managed to convince Maria (My girlfriend) to go along, which wasn’t very difficult, especially as I also got Helena and Raul involved. I picked up the gear on Thursday from
  %a{ :href => "http://www.cordada.org/" }
    Cordada
  and arranged to meet Toni outside Eroski in Cornella at 07:00.
%p
  When I told Maria and Helena at what time they’d need to get up, they got a bit piqued to say the least ;), threatening to not go etc etc. I think Maria convinced her friend in the end, but they were both bitterly complaining right up until Toni arrived on the Saturday morning (Actually they were more asleep at that time but they still managed to complain a bit at certain moments of leucidness).
%p
  The trip up to Oliana we a lot quicker than we expected. We took the A2, up until the

      C1412
  turnoff towards Calaf and arrived at
  %a{ :href => "http://www.alturgell.org/Oliana.html" }
    Oliana
  at just before 09:00. The others arrived a few moments before hand and we got a good breakfeast in.
%p
  Heading off for the dam, we easily found the spot were we had to leave the cars and trek up to the start of the ferrata (On the road to the dam, at

      KM 59
  , just next to the old bridge which is practically in ruins).
%p
  After gearing up it was an easy half hour walk up to the start of the ferrata. I was leasantly surprised to find that you needed to do a bit of climbing to get to the first metal bar. I was also pleasantly susprised that everyone got by that first stumbling block with apparent ease.
%p
  The ferrata is divided into three route:
%ul
  %li
    Route A (Difficulty C – Moderately difficult) was only slightly testing, as I starts off vertically for   quite a bit but on the whole it was a good intro (It was a first for most of us).
%ul
  %li
    Route B (Difficulty C – Moderately difficult) was really quite nice. It involved going up a needle to see   the incredible view and then having to come back down the same way. Then we had to cross a   nepalese-type bridge which was fun.
%ul
  %li
    Route C (D+ – Very difficult) was a bit more testing. It was basically vertical to overhung most of the way.   There was a very nice needle cross-over (i.e. The trail ended and you had to switch walls by reaching out and   grabbing for the bar on the other side of the wall.) which I thoroughly enjoyed as a very nice breeze was blowing   as we crossed it. There were a lot off horizantal bits, which we had to traverse which were at about 250 metres high,   so the views were really breathtaking. Towards the end we had the choice of taking a route to the left (easier) and   to the right (more overhangs). Most of us chose the left route as we had run out of water and were wuite anxious to   get the ferrata over with and get back down. Toni, though, did do the route on the right and remarked that it was   just as well we didn’t choose that route in the state we were.
%p
  Highlights of the ferrata for me were the incredibly beautiful scenery as viewed from a number of ledges, a couple of hundred metres high.
%p
  But what really made this one special was the incredibly close-up views we got of
  %a{ :href => "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lammergeier" }
    ‘Quebrantahueso(es)/Trencaos(ca)/Lammergeier(en)’
  vultures. There were loads of them. They obviously had their nests in one of the cliffs opposite us, and we saw a great number of them just coming in over us and gliding over towards their nests. They got so close at one point we could actually clearly make out a lot of details including their eyes, beaks and the rustling of their feathers as they soared through the air.
%p
  They generally flew in pairs but at some points a couple of pairs would get together and on one occasion we saw 4 pairs all soaring in unison (i.e 8 of these magnificent creatures). Very nice indeed.
%p
  I’m afraid, though, that nobody got the time to take a snap of them but I haven’t got the photos through yet so I’m might still be pleasantly surprised.
%p
  The trek backdown (at the beginning via an equipped path) was really exhasuting for most as we had completely used up every last drop of water, and the sun was beating down. The girls were the worst for wear. Both Maria and Helena were a bit dazed when we finally got back to the cars.
%p
  A group of guys very graciously supplied us with water which kept us going until we got the the supermarket at Oliana, were we were seen roaming the corridors, each drinking litres of water or juice and eating fresh fruit.
%p
  We really had a great time. Well worth the effort.
