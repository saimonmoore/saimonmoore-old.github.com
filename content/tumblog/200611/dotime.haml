%p
  I have a
  %a{ :href => "http://www.basecamphq.com/signup.php" }
    Basic
  Basecamp plan. This plan doesn’t include time tracking. I think time tracking is an indispensable part of any basecamp plan but there you go, that’s life.
%p
  So what to do?
%p
  I present you with
  %a{ :href => "http://www.saimonmoore.net/assets/2006/11/15/DoTime-0.0.2.gem" }
    DoTime-0.0.2
%p
  Install:
%pre
  %code
    sudo gem install DoTime --include-dependencies
%p
  Usage:
%pre
  %code
    dotime -u {your_basecamp_login} -p {your_basecamp_password}
%p
  Follow the online instructions…It’s quite easy….
%p
  I’m accepting feature requests and could do with some feedback. This could be slightly faster but it’s basically dependant on basecamp’s api so I’m not sure there’s much improvement in that respect.
%p
  I’ve been using it for about a month now and am very happy with it.
  Of course I’m hoping that this ‘tool’ pushes
  %a{ :href => "http://www.37signals.com" }
    37 Signals
  into making time tracking available for all plans.
