%p
  My current project is based on
  %a{ :href => "http://mephistoblog.com" }
    Mephisto
  \. Consequently Iâ€™m editing
  %a{ :href => "http://home.leetsoft.com/liquid" }
    liquid
  templates a lot.
%p
  I quickly got bored of editing them using plain text mode so I very quickly wrote up a liquid mode for
  %a{ :href => "http://www.jedit.org" }
    jEdit
  \.
%p
  You can find it
  %a{ :href => "/assets/2006/12/7/liquid.xml" }
    here
%h4
  Usage
%p
  Add the following to $home/.jedit/modes/catalog :
%code
  \&lt;MODE NAME="liquid" FILE="liquid.xml" FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.liquid" /&gt;
%p
  While I was at it I added a few
  %a{ :href => "http://saimonmoore.net/assets/2006/12/7/liquid" }
    abbreviations
  for the liquid mode. Just add that file to $home/.jedit/SuperAbbrevs and restart jedit.
