%p
  These are a few of the languages I would like to learn:
%ul
  %li
    Common Lisp
  %li
    Smalltalk
  %li
    Eiffel
  %li
    Haskel
  %li
    Prolog
%p
  Don’t have much time at the moment but I’d really like to get a hold of a few good tutorials on getting to grips on any of these languages.

  If anyone has any recommendations I’d like to hear from you. I’d prefer a hands on approach rather than too theoretical, something I can eat up in chunks.
