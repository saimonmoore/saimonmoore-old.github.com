%p
  I just spent an hour trying to figure out why an assigned liquid drop I was using was not being rendered within the liquid template.
%p
  The strange reason being that I had an include with the same name as the drop’s assigned key.
%p
  e.g.
Before…
%pre
  %code
    {% include 'flash' %}
    
    In _flash.liquid
    
    {{flash.notice}} &lt;--- Doesn't render anything
After…
%pre
  %code
    {% include 'messages' %}
    
    In _messages.liquid
    
    {{flash.notice}} &lt;--- Renders correctly
