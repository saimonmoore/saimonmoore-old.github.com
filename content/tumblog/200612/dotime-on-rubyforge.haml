%p
  Iâ€™ve just released
  %a{ :href => "http://www.saimonmoore.net/2006/11/15/dotime" }
    DoTime
  on
  %a{ :href => "http://rubyforge.org/projects/dotime/" }
    rubyforge
%p
  The gem has already propagated so you can now just do:
%pre
  %code
    sudo gem install dotime -y
%p
  to get the latest release directly from rubyforge.
%p
  For changes in this release see this

    hoe
  the process was completely painless.
