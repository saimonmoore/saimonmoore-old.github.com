  I bought a Macbook ~4 months ago.
  %p
    Last week my Macbook refused to startup after a reboot. I took it in to an Apple shop and they said it would take a week to repair. It’s been more than a week and they’ve now told me, that they get the HD’s from the Netherlands and that they’ve run out of stock. Yep, you heard right, they’ve run out of stocks of HD’s belonging to 4 month old macbooks.
  I’ll post again when it has actually been replaced.
