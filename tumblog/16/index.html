          </h2>
          <p>I&#8217;m about to start an <a href=http://www.open.ac.uk/>Open University</a> IT course. Most probably, it&#8217;ll be something like Computing with Mathematics, though, I&#8217;d like to chop and change the courses a bit.</p>  <p> I&#8217;ll probably start the combined <i>Using Mathematics/Exploring Mathematics</i> course in Febuary, so that should keep me busy for next year and get me up to speed for doing Level 2/Level 3 course the year after. </p> <p>  So it looks like I&#8217;m going to be very busy for the next few years as each 60 point course requires a minimum of 16hrs/week dedicated study time.</p>  <p> That combined with my open source work, ,my extra-curricular learning and then trying to fit in freelance work, means I&#8217;m going to have my work cut out for me.</p>  <p> This is probably going to be quite a strain on the relationship but as Maria is also about to start a distance learning course, we should really auto-regulate each other to be stict and dedicated.</p>  <p> All this means, I&#8217;m going to need to make a drastic change in my lifestyle and character:</p>  <h5><span class="caps">ORGANIZATION</span> &amp; <span class="caps">ROUTINE</span></h5>  <p> Not really in my list of preferred vocabulary but it&#8217;ll be worth the sacrifice.</p>  <p> I&#8217;m going to register tomorrow, and start preparing for the course. Thankfully I&#8217;ve recently gone through a revision of basic algebra, trig and geometry so I shouldn&#8217;t find the maths very challenging (At least not until &#8216;Exploring Mathematics&#8217;, Level 2).</p>  <p> I&#8217;ve always enjoyed maths and was quite good at it back at school.</p>   <p> I&#8217;m looking to gain a maths basis for getting to grips with discrete maths and algorithms which is where my lack of previous study is showing most.</p>  <p>So busy, busy, busy&#8230;.</p>  <p> Just have to get organized, that&#8217;s all ;) </p> Any tips?<p></p>

          </h2>
          <p>Weekend in the pyrenees. Nice opportunity to go climbing.</p> <p> I borrowed a copy of <a href=http://www.onaclimb.com/guies/index.htm>&#8216;Roca Caliente (Hot Rock) en los Pirineos&#8217;</a> by <a href=http://www.onaclimb.com/luichy/index.htm>Luis Alfonso</a>. Decided that the best place would be around the <a href=http://www.tinet.org/%7Eearguis/Catalunya/FotosCatalunya/Aiguestortes/bigimages/31%20Embalse%20Cavallers.jpg>&#8216;Cavallers&#8217; dam</a> (15 minutes drive from Caldes de Boi in the &#8216;Parc Nacional de Aigues Tortes i St.Maurici&#8217;).</p>  <p> I basically chose something quite easy as Maria hasn&#8217;t climbed a lot. We went to the <strong>&#8216;Kanalla&#8217;</strong> sector which is basically mostly IV and a couple of V/V+.</p>  <p> I setup a IV route for her, which she climbed quite well, but which shook her a bit. It&#8217;s very easy but it&#8217;s basically all adhesion.</p>  <p> She didn&#8217;t want to climb after that, but was quite happy to belay me. I only did a few routes myself (A couple at IV and 1 at IV+), but they were a joy to climb.</p>  <p> And the setting was just fantastic. (I have photos which I&#8217;ll be posting just as soon as I can get the photo app part of bligi up).</p>  <p> I&#8217;m definitely going to go back and try something a bit more testing&#8230;</p><p></p>

          <p> I&#8217;m now running <a href=http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17>switchtower.</a> </p> <p> Easy peasy to setup. I basically followed instructions in the manual.</p>  <ol> <li>svn co http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/trunk/switchtower/</li>  <li>rake gem</li>  <li>Created a basic recipe (deploy.rb) from the example and stuck it in $RAILS_APP_ROOT/config/deploy.rb</li>  <li> type:   <code>switchtower -r config/deploy.rb -a deploy</code></li>  <li>Watch how your app get&#8217;s deployed  with no other action on your part.</li>  <p>Well worth the five minutes effort to get the recipe file written up.</p>  <p> Couldn&#8217;t find the s&#8217;pinner/spawner/reaper&#8217; scripts but I haven&#8217;t looked in the rails svn trunk yet.</p>  <p> Example: </p>  <p> I fixed the &#8216;Weaning Problem&#8217; I was having with bligi on my laptop this morning.</p>   <p> When I had it working, all I had to do was type the above command, and a minute later I could post live with bligi.</p>  <p>That&#8217;s the way I like things to go&#8230;Smoothly. ;)</p>  <p><span class="caps">TODO</span>: As I&#8217;ve only got the basic package at textdrive (i.e. 300Megs), I&#8217;m going to have to limit the number of app versions to three (Current version and the last two).
