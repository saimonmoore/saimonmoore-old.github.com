          </h2>
          <p>I&#8217;m about to start an <a href=http://www.open.ac.uk/>Open University</a> IT course. Most probably, it&#8217;ll be something like Computing with Mathematics, though, I&#8217;d like to chop and change the courses a bit.</p>  <p> I&#8217;ll probably start the combined <i>Using Mathematics/Exploring Mathematics</i> course in Febuary, so that should keep me busy for next year and get me up to speed for doing Level 2/Level 3 course the year after. </p> <p>  So it looks like I&#8217;m going to be very busy for the next few years as each 60 point course requires a minimum of 16hrs/week dedicated study time.</p>  <p> That combined with my open source work, ,my extra-curricular learning and then trying to fit in freelance work, means I&#8217;m going to have my work cut out for me.</p>  <p> This is probably going to be quite a strain on the relationship but as Maria is also about to start a distance learning course, we should really auto-regulate each other to be stict and dedicated.</p>  <p> All this means, I&#8217;m going to need to make a drastic change in my lifestyle and character:</p>  <h5><span class="caps">ORGANIZATION</span> &amp; <span class="caps">ROUTINE</span></h5>  <p> Not really in my list of preferred vocabulary but it&#8217;ll be worth the sacrifice.</p>  <p> I&#8217;m going to register tomorrow, and start preparing for the course. Thankfully I&#8217;ve recently gone through a revision of basic algebra, trig and geometry so I shouldn&#8217;t find the maths very challenging (At least not until &#8216;Exploring Mathematics&#8217;, Level 2).</p>  <p> I&#8217;ve always enjoyed maths and was quite good at it back at school.</p>   <p> I&#8217;m looking to gain a maths basis for getting to grips with discrete maths and algorithms which is where my lack of previous study is showing most.</p>  <p>So busy, busy, busy&#8230;.</p>  <p> Just have to get organized, that&#8217;s all ;) </p> Any tips?<p></p>
