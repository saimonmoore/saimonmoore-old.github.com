            <a href="/tumblog/20061/jedit-for-ruby-rails-development.html">jEdit for ruby/rails development</a>
          </h2>
          <p>I was recently reading through my feeds when I came across the following
          <a href="http://akshayrawat.net/blog/?p=3">post</a>. Akshay was musing over how great jEdit
          is for ruby/rails development.</p>
          
              <p>I totally agree with him so I commented on his post and while writing the
          comment I decided it was high time to write my own article on using jEdit for
          ruby/rails development.</p>
          
              <p>I first found <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a> about 6 to 7 years ago and ever
          since then it&#8217;s been my number one programmers editor. I&#8217;d dabbled with ide&#8217;s
          like eclipse and intellij for java development but always in combination with
          jEdit for web work.</p>
          
              <p>Ever since I switched to ruby/rails development I&#8217;ve found that jEdit adapted
          extremely well and thanks to Rob Mckinnon&#8217;s
          <a href="http://www.jedit.org/ruby">Ruby plug-in for jEdit</a> , all the more so.</p>
          
              <p>jEdit is a programmers editor written by <a href="http://factor-language.blogspot.com/">Slava Pestov</a>
          
           (author of the <a href="http://factorcode.org/">Factor</a> language) in java. I&#8217;m not going to go
          into details about what jEdit is and isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m just going to go over how I use
          jEdit for my rails development and why I think it&#8217;s a great development
          environment for rails work on any platform.</p>
          
              <p>It comes with edit modes (syntax highlighting) for over a hundred different
          languages (ruby,(x)html,css,javascript,yaml etc&#8230;).
          Writing your own is not that difficult if you find you have to.
          I&#8217;ve written a couple myself (For the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity">velocity</a>
          templating engine and the <a href="http://www.tads.org/"><span class="caps">TADS</span></a> language)
          In fact I&#8217;m thinking about writing one for rhtml soon ;) I currently have rhtml
          set up as html mode.</p>
          
              <p>jEdit also has a very powerful macro system based on beanshell (macros can be written
           in ruby, python or any bsf scripting language thanks to the superscript plug-in).
           i.e. you can hook in ruby/rake calls.</p>
          
              <p>One of the main features I love about this editor is practically everything has
          a configurable key shortcut which means I very rarely have to touch the mouse at
          all and that saves on a lot of time.</p>
          
              <p><strong><em>The shortcuts menu option&#8230;</em></strong></p>
          
              <p><img src="/assets/2006/10/12/shortcuts.png" alt=""></p>
          
              <p>It has a very modular structure allowing you to lazy load in a very large number
          of plug-ins, available <a href=http://plugins.jedit.org/>here</a> or via jEdit itself via the
          Plugin Manager (Recommended &#8211; For those stuck behind a corporate firewall,
          
          	<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rozmanov/ntlm/"><span class="caps">APS</span></a> comes in handy).</p>
          (Only loaded on first use).</p>

          <img src="/assets/2006/10/12/plugins-o-z.png" alt=""></p>
          very handy for ruby development. He then decided to tie them all together into
          a plug-in.</p>
          You can also have it as a quick pop-up&#8230;</p></li>
              </ul>
          if you have the rdocs tab open it&#8217;ll also automatically point to the
          documentation of the method you&#8217;ve currently selected.</p>
          syntax error in your ruby code.</p>
          typed and indented for you.</pre></li>
              </ul>
          documentation included as well. You can esily search ri with a quick shortcut.</p></li>
              </ul>
          have an &#8220;Introduce variable refactoring&#8221; which I don&#8217;t use myself but it&#8217;s a
          start.</p></li>
              </ul>
          for all it&#8217;s edit modes.</p></li>
          migrations, just like <span class=caps><span class="caps">DHH</span></span> uses) available <a href="/assets/2006/10/12/ruby">here</a></p>
          (docked in at the bottom).</p>
          very handy. This in combination with the rectangular selection (column insert)
          mode and the clipboard history  makes for very powerful editing.</p>
          jEdit written to cover many different needs. Macros are quick and easy way to
          extend jEdit&#8217;s functionality without having to write a full-blown plug-in (in java).
          As I mentioned you can write your macros in ruby and each macro can be assigned
          a shortcut. If you find you&#8217;re missing functionality that <i><span class="caps">XXX</span></i> editor you used
          before had, chances are someone&#8217;s gone ahead and written a macro for it. If not
          you can write it yourself or ask someone in the large jEdit community to do
          it for you (if they happen to feel like it and you ask nicely).
          I forgot to mention that you can download macros from the community from within
          jEdit itself via the MacroManager plug-in (you&#8217;ll find a few I&#8217;ve written myself
          up there).</p>
          Let me tell you that there was a time when jvm&#8217;s were quite laggy but not anymore.
          I run jEdit using sun&#8217;s 1.5 jvm. I start it with the following command:</p></p>
          
          
          <p><strong><em>Java and performance</em></strong></p>
          
          <p>Quite a few people out there complain about how java apps are low-performant.
          
          <code></code><pre>java -mx64m -jar /usr/local/share/jedit/4.3pre2/jedit.jar -background -nogui &amp;amp;</pre>
          
              <p>This is added to my fluxbox init file, so that jedit is started up in the
          background every time I restart X.
          I&#8217;ve assigned the &#8216;e&#8217; alias to the following startup command:</p>
          
          <code></code><pre>jedit -reuseview</pre>
          
              <p>So whenever I want to start editing a file, there is no startup lag at all.</p>
          
              <p>Right,</p>
          
              <p>I&#8217;ll leave you with a final screen shot of jedit split into 4 screens working on
          a few different kinds of rails files. I&#8217;m using the &#8220;profont&#8221; font and a custom
          jedit editor colour scheme that is similar to the <a href="http://encytemedia.com/blog/articles/2006/01/03/textmate-vibrant-ink-theme-and-prototype-bundle">Vibrant Ink</a> textmate theme.</p><p></p>
