<p>These are a few of the languages I would like to learn:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Common Lisp</li>
		<li>Smalltalk</li>
		<li>Eiffel</li>
		<li>Haskel</li>
		<li>Prolog</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Don&#8217;t have much time at the moment but I&#8217;d really like to get a hold of a few good tutorials on getting to grips on any of these languages.</p>


	<p>If anyone has any recommendations I&#8217;d like to hear from you. I&#8217;d prefer a hands on approach rather than too theoretical, something I can eat up in chunks.</p>
