<p>Though, I&#8217;ve had the site up for a few days, I was coming across a problem in production I&#8217;d not been having before.</p>  <p>Namely, a <b><i>412 &#8216;Pre-condition Failed&#8217; </i></b>error.</p>  <p> At first I was stumped, and thought that  this was something to do with, the security authorization on posts filter I had setup. But after, not finding anything in the logs, I started to suspect the ajax code.</p>  <p>  A google search led me to the textdrive forums, which then led me to the following error in httpd-error.log:</p>  <pre>[Wed Aug 17 03:16:23 2005] [error] [client 83.50.184.178] mod_security: Access denied with code 412. Error parsing POST parameters: Error normalizing parameter value: Invalid character detected [0] [hostname saimonmoore.net]</pre>  <p> So I had a look at the post form and then remembered that I marshalling the list parameter map and passing the generated code as a form param.</p>  <p> Needless to say that was, producing some very strange characters that mod_security didn&#8217;t like.</p>  <p> So I replaced the code with </p>  <pre><code>Object.inspect()/Object.eval_instance()</code></pre>  <p>No more funny characters..no more problem&#8230;</p>  <p> Works great&#8230; I can now post live to my hearts content. ;)</p><p></p>
