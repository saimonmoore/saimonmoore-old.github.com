I bought a Macbook ~4 months ago.

	<p>Last week my Macbook refused to startup after a reboot. I took it in to an Apple shop and they said it would take a week to repair. It&#8217;s been more than a week and they&#8217;ve now told me, that they get the HD&#8217;s from the Netherlands and that they&#8217;ve run out of stock. Yep, you heard right, they&#8217;ve run out of stocks of HD&#8217;s belonging to 4 month old macbooks.</p>


I&#8217;ll post again when it has actually been replaced.
