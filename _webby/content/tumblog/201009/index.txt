I've been working on fairtilizer.com pretty much full time for the last 2 years. This august the team flipped the switch on a new branding Official.fm, the idea being massiveattack.official.fm.
As I was off on holidaysi, huge congratulations to the officialfm team are due.

Hopefully will be blogging more often now (I think I said that about 2 years ago too :)
